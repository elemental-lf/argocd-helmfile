        kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v2.7.9/manifests/install.yaml

            ## Quick Start

            ### Non-HA:

            ```shell
            kubectl create namespace argocd
            kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v2.7.9/manifests/install.yaml
            ```

            ### HA:

            ```shell
            kubectl create namespace argocd
            kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v2.7.9/manifests/ha/install.yaml
            ```

            ## Release Signatures and Provenance

            All Argo CD container images are signed by cosign.  A Provenance is generated for container images and CLI binaries which meet the SLSA Level 3 specifications. See the [documentation](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/signed-release-assets) on how to verify.


            ## Upgrading

            If upgrading from a different minor version, be sure to read the [upgrading](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/upgrading/overview/) documentation.
